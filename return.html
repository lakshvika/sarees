        <span class="policy-subtitle">Commitment to Quality & Customer Satisfaction</span>

        <p>At Lakshvika, every saree is a labor of love, handwoven by skilled artisans. We perform a rigorous 3-step quality check before shipping any product. However, we understand that sometimes a product may not meet your expectations. Below is our policy regarding returns and exchanges.</p>

        <h2>1. Domestic Orders (India)</h2>
        <p>For orders delivered within India, we offer a customer-friendly return window.</p>
        
        <div class="policy-box">
            <h3>7-Day Return Window</h3>
            <p>You may raise a return request within <strong>7 days</strong> from the date of delivery.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Conditions for Return:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The product must be unused, unworn, and unwashed.</li>
            <li>All original tags, packaging, and the authenticity certificate must be intact.</li>
            <li>The saree must <strong>not</strong> have the blouse piece cut or fall/pico done.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-Returnable Items:</h3>
        <p>We cannot accept returns for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customized items (e.g., pre-stitched blouses, altered lengths).</li>
            <li>Sarees where the blouse piece has been detached.</li>
            <li>Products bought during a "Clearance Sale."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. International Orders (Outside India)</h2>
        <p>Due to the complex nature of international shipping, customs, and import duties, our policy differs for global clients.</p>

        <div class="policy-box">
            <h3>Final Sale Policy</h3>
            <p>All international orders are considered <strong>Final Sale</strong> and are generally <strong>not eligible for returns or exchanges</strong> due to high logistic costs and cross-border regulations.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Exceptions (Damaged Goods):</h3>
        <p>If you receive a damaged or incorrect product, please contact us within <strong>48 hours</strong> of delivery with clear photographs. We will review the case and offer either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A partial refund for minor fixable issues.</li>
            <li>A full refund or replacement if the product is significantly damaged or incorrect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Lakshvika is not responsible for minor color variations due to screen resolution or natural variations in handloom weaving.</em></p>
